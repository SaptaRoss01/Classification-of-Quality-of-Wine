1) Executed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset with 12 attributes and nearly 5000 instances(usedggplot2inR)
2) Removed pre‐existing multicollinearity present in the dataset using VIF and fitted a Multiple Logistic Regression Model
3) Obtained the performance metrics:Accuracy of 71.32%, Precision of 84.81%, and an F1‐Score of 76.26% on the test data
4) Plotted the ROC Curve and obtained an Area Under the Curve‐ Score of 0.789 by using the threshold probability of 0.658
